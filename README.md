# Pixel Prop Builder: Streamlined OTA to Build.prop Conversion

Effortlessly extract and manage system properties from Pixel OTA updates with this robust automation suite. Designed for developers and enthusiasts alike, it simplifies the process of accessing and customizing Android build properties.

## üöÄ Quick Start & Requirements Integration

### Environment Setup & Acquisition

- Ensure a Unix-like environment with **Bash**.
- Install **core utilities**: `dos2unix`, `aria2`, `zip`, `unzip`, `p7zip`, `curl`, `jq`, and Python ^3.10.
   ```bash
   # Install python3.12
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-distutils
   # Install python-pip
   aria2c https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py && python3.12 get-pip.py && rm get-pip.py
   ```

- Clone the project alongside its submodules:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pixel-Props/build.prop --recurse
    ```

- Install payload_dumper
    ```bash
    python3.12 -m pip install payload_dumper/
    ```

1. **Obtain Pixel Images:** Download the desired factory or OTA images from [Google Android Images](https://developers.google.com/android/images) or the [Beta OTA Pages](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/download-ota).
2. **Effortless Extraction:**
   - Place the downloaded image files within the project's workspace.
   - Execute `./extract_images.sh` to automatically extract build properties.
3. **Stay Up-to-Date:**
   - Fetch the latest OTA images with `./download_latest_ota_build.sh <device_name1> <device_name2> ...` (e.g., `husky`, `felix_beta`, `cheetah`, `akita_beta15`).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automated OTA Acquisition:**  Downloads the latest builds directly from Google's official sources.
- **Seamless Image Extraction:**  Extracts system images from both factory images and OTA updates.
- **Build Prop Generation:** Automatically generates `build.prop` files from extracted system images.
- **Magisk Module Features:**
  - **`service.sh`:**
    - **Safe Mode:** Prevents accidental modification of critical system settings by comparing module properties with existing system values.
  - **`action.sh`:**
    - **PlayIntegrityFix:**  Automatically builds the `PIF.json` configuration when using a Beta OTA. Provides options to download pre-built configurations or crawl Google's OTA pages to generate a list of devices for building the configuration.
    - **TrickyStore:** Automatically builds the target app package list and handles broken TEE status.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
  - **Scheduled Workflows:** Automate updates, builds, and releases on a schedule.
    - **Duplicate Release Prevention:** Prevents redundant releases with intelligent checks.
    - **Telegram Notifications:** Receive timely updates about build processes.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - **[Pixel.Features](https://github.com/Pixel-Props/pixel.features/):** Add support for building Pixel-specific features (currently includes `sysconfigs`).
