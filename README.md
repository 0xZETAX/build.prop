# build.prop
 Bash script to build your own system.prop

## How to use
Simply drag and drop your images into the build.prop root directory and execute `extract_images.sh`, If you are wondering where i get my images from they are all from the [Google Android Images](https://developers.google.com/android/images).

## Why?
I wrote this in a quick day so it might look unfinished, But the why is that it takes me a long time to do all by hand so a bit of automatization should help me.

## Todo
- [ ] Compare and download latest image from the [Google Android Images](https://developers.google.com/android/images).
- [ ] Create and push updates on github
- [x] Extract factory images
- [x] Build system.prop
- [x]  Check for dependencies

You can also help me finish those todo's by forking this repository, modifying the script and pushing a pull request.
